# rpmostree-update

Wrapper of `rpm-ostree update` that remembers previous updates.

This may eventually be renamed to rpmostree-tool or rpmostree-wrapper or rpmost say or something similar... if it gains more command features.

Experiment, not ready yet for general use.

## Installation

`stack install` or `cabal install`
