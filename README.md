# rpmostree-update

Wrapper of `rpm-ostree update` that remembers previous update info.
Also outputs changelog.

This may eventually be renamed to rpmostree-tool or rpmostree-wrapper or rpmost say or something similar... if it gains more command features.

Still experimental

## Installation

`stack install` or `cabal install`
